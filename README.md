Do you want to work with big data? I mean really big data. Some research projects require that we sift through and attempt to find meaning within an extraordinary volume of data. This workshop will introduce you to a popular tool you can use to store, manage, and work with data that are too big to fit on your computer's memory: Google's BigQuery. This friendly introduction will provide you with the skills required to upload, structure, and work with your data all from within R: no SQL required!
